 <h2>Ingridients</h2>

 <p>Believe it or not, this homemade cranberry sauce comes together quickly and easily with just three easy-to-find ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>
 
 <br>

 <ul>
    <li>12 ounces cranberries : Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar :White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</li>
    <li>1 cup orange juice :All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</li>
 </ul>
